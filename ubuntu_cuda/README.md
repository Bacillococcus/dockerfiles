# Ubuntu with cuda from nvidia repo instead of ubuntu default repo (which ship with relatively old cuda version for lts build)

Go to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive and follow installation instruction, use local version and install nvidia-driver version we wanted before install cuda (for some reason the installation failed if we install directly from cuda packages).
